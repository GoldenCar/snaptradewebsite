        <h3>3. Important Securities Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>You understand that no content published on the Site constitutes a recommendation that any particular security, portfolio of securities, transaction or investment strategy is suitable for any specific person. You further understand that none of the bloggers, information providers, App providers, or their affiliates are advising you personally concerning the nature, potential, value or suitability of any particular security, portfolio of securities, transaction, investment strategy or other matter. To the extent that any of the content published on the Site may be deemed to be investment advice or recommendations in connection with a particular security, such information is impersonal and not tailored to the investment needs of any specific person. You understand that an investment in any security is subject to a number of risks, and that discussions of any security published on the Site will not contain a list or description of relevant risk factors. In addition, please note that some of the stocks about which content is published on the Site have a low market capitalization and/or insufficient public float. Such stocks are subject to more risk than stocks of larger companies, including greater volatility, lower liquidity and less publicly available information. Blogs, postings or content on the Site which may or may not be deemed by you to be recommendations may have an effect on their stock prices.</p>

        a solicitation of an offer to buy, or a recommendation for any security by Snaptrade or any third party.
        You alone are solely responsible for determining whether any investment, security or strategy, or any other product or service,
        is appropriate or suitable for you based on your investment objectives and personal and financial situation.
        You should consult an attorney or tax professional regarding your specific legal or tax situation.</p>
