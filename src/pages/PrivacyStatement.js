        <h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
        <p>Thank you for visiting https://snaptrade.us (together with all other websites and services operated by or on behalf of Snaptrade., the "Site"). Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used at the Site. This Privacy Policy forms part of the Terms of Use.</p>
        <p>Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Terms of Use.</p>

        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
        <p>We are committed to respecting your online privacy, and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you share with us.</p>
        <p>Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name,
        personal profile, a home or other physical address and an email address or other contact information, whether at work or at home.
        Currently, we do not require you to provide Personal Information in order to have access to the free commentary, analysis and news available on our Site.
        However, in order to provide you with some of the Sites services, you must create a profile, register and provide your email address, username, password and other specified information. At a later time, you may add additional Personal Information to your profile. In addition, we may collect Feedback from you, including in connection with User Submissions on the Site.</p>
        <p>We may use your email address and Snaptrade email account to send updates, a newsletter or news regarding our services, and those of our advertisers who may have relevant offers.</p>
        <p>You may choose not to receive email from a particular sender by rolling your mouse over the text of an email in your Snaptrade email account and blocking that sender. If you receive the email from Snaptrade in an email account other than your Snaptrade email account and wish to block that sender, simply go into your Snaptrade email account and block that sender in the same way. Furthermore, if you do not wish to receive email from one of our advertisers, you may unsubscribe from receiving further email from that advertiser.</p>
        <p>Snaptrade strives to comply with all applicable laws around the globe that are designed to protect your privacy. Although legal requirements may vary from country to country, Snaptrade intends to adhere to the principles set forth in this Privacy Policy even if, in connection with the above, we transfer your Personal Information from your country to countries that may not require an "adequate" level of protection for your Personal Information. In other words, our goal is to provide protection for your Personal Information no matter where that Personal Information is collected, transferred, or retained.

        <h3>2. Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h3>
        <h4>Web Cookies</h4>
        <p>A “Web Cookie” is a string of information that a website stores on a user’s computer, and that the user’s browser provides to the website each time the user submits a query to the site. We use Web Cookies to track the pages that users visit during each Site session, both to help us improve users’ experiences and to help us understand how the Site is being used. As with other non-Personal Information gathered from users of the Site, we analyze and disclose in aggregated form information gathered using Web Cookies, so as to help us, our partners and others better understand how the Site is being used. We do not attempt to link information gathered using Web Cookies to Personal Information. USERS WHO DO NOT WISH TO HAVE WEB COOKIES PLACED ON THEIR COMPUTERS SHOULD SET THEIR BROWSERS TO REFUSE WEB COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THE SITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE SITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF WEB COOKIES. USERS WHO REFUSE WEB COOKIES ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY.</p>

        <h4>Web Beacons</h4>
        <p>A “Web Beacon” is an object that is embedded in a web page that is usually invisible to the user and allows website operators to check whether a user has viewed a particular web page or an email. We may use Web Beacons on the Site and in emails to count users who have visited particular pages, viewed emails, and to deliver co-branded services. Web Beacons are not used to access users’ Personal Information; they are a technique we may use to compile aggregated statistics about Site usage. Web Beacons collect only a limited set of information including a Web Cookie number, time and date of a page or email view, and a description of the page or email on which the Web Beacon resides. You may not decline Web Beacons, however, they can be rendered ineffective by declining all Web Cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a Web Cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline Web Cookies on an individual basis.</p>
